# Data Visualisation & Exploratory Analysis with R 

Within this repository, I have attached three R scripts written as a project for my MSc in Behavioural and Economic Science.

The R packages employed here are:
* lattice (with xyplot)
* latticeExtra

The statistical methods employed are: 
* Simple linear regression 
* ANOVA

## 1. Does unemployment affect the well being of conscientious people more? 

The results of the simple regression suggest we may infer the following from the data:
* Unemployment seems to have a significantly negative impact on well-being (p = 0.00902) as compared to the well-being of those who are employed 
* Conscientious individuals are also more likely to have their well-being impacted for each unit increase in self-reported conscientiousness, well-being falls by 0.28 on a 1-10 scale.

*Graph displaying conscientiousness and well-being filtered by employment where 'Yes' represents recently unemployed and 'No' represents recently employed*

## 2. How does divorce affect mental health? Is the impact the same for men and women? 



## 3. How does distress after diagnosis of a serious illness vary depending on whether a person blames themselves or circumstances?
